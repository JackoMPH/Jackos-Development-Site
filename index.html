      <h2>Project Hunstanton Story</h2>
      <p>
        Project Hunstanton was taken down due to a false claim from a rival group who believed I used their assets, despite them being created by me. Their community existed before mine, but my success outpaced theirs rapidly. Roblox sided with them, and unfortunately, the game was removed and never reinstated. This only fueled my motivation to keep building better.
